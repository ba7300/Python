Twinkle Twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are! 
Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazzing son is gone, when he nothing shine upon!
Then you show your little light, Twinkle Twinkle all the night.

Then the traveler in the dark, Thanks you for your tiny spark!
How could he see where to go, If you did not twinkle so.

In the dark blue sky you keep, Often through my curtains peep!
For you never shut your eye, Till the sun is in the sky.

As your bright and tiny spark, Lights the traveler in the sky!
Through I know not what you are, Twinkle Twinkle little star.
